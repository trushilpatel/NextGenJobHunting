  ```
  git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
  ```
- **Bug Fix Branches**: For fixing bugs or issues.
  ```
  git checkout -b bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>
  ```
- **Test Branches**: For adding or modifying tests.
  ```
  git checkout -b test/<test-name>
  ```
- **Documentation Branches**: For updating or creating documentation.
  ```
  git checkout -b docs/<document-name>
  ```
